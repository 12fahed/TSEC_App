            |--<name>_model.dart
            |--<name>_model.g.dart
    |--providers/                   # Every provider should be in different file
        |--<name>_provider.dart
    |--screens/                     # Contains all the UI elements of app
        |--<foo>_screen/            # Each screen should have a folder and follow foo_screen convention
            |--widgets/             # Smaller widgets which help in building the screen
            |--foo_screen.dart      # App screen

```

For tests same folder structure should be followed in `test/` folder.

## Application Layers

![Application layers](https://github.com/bizz84/starter_architecture_flutter_firebase/blob/master/media/application-layers.png?raw=true)

To ensure a good separation of concerns, this architecture defines three main application layers.

- **UI Layer**: where the widgets live
- **Logic & Presentation Layer**: this contains the application's business and presentation logic
- **Domain Layer**: this contains domain-specific services for interacting with 3rd party APIs

*These layers may be named differently in other literature.*

What matters here is that the data flows from the services into the widgets, and the call flow goes in the opposite direction.

Widgets **subscribe** themselves as listeners, while view models **publish** updates when something changes.
